Fiber Laser Engraving Solder Mask and Silkscreen on DIY PCBs

A fiber laser can be incorporated in the final phase of making beautiful high gloss circuit boards at home.

This a three step process which involves: 

1. apply resin
2. engrave the silkscreen
3. engrave the pads

Why add these layers to prototypes?
===
1. Lasts Longer - It will not be exposed to nearly as much oxidation or at risk from accidental trace scratches.

2. Stronger - Single sided FR1 boards are typically 1.5mm thick. They can be snapped with your bare hands.

3. Assembly - Stuffing is easier with orientation, component labels and reduced risk of bridging between pads with the solder mask in place.

4. Kind of professional - A raw board looks like cool, but not nearly as good as one with the silkscreen + mask layers.

5. Quick - It doesn't take that long. Once you get the process down you can complete the silkscreen + mask layers in less than 20 minutes.
