Fiber Laser Engraving Solder Mask and Silkscreen on DIY PCBs


A fiber laser can be incorporated in the final phase of making beautiful high gloss circuit boards at home.

This a three step process which involves: 

1. applying resin
2. engraving the silkscreen
3. engraving the pads

Why add these layers to prototypes?
===
1. The PCB will last longer. It will not be exposed to nearly as much oxidation or at risk from accidental trace scratches.

2. The PCB will be stronger. Single sided FR1 boards are typically 1.5mm thick. They can be snapped with your bare hands.

3. Assembly (stuffing) is easier with orientation, component labels and reduced risk of bridging between pads with the solder mask in place.

4. The PCB looks kind of professional. A raw board looks like cool, but not nearly as good as one with the silkscreen + mask layers.

5. It doesn't take that long. Once you get the process down you can complete the silkscreen + mask layers in less than 20 minutes.
